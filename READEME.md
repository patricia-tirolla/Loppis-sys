# Loppis-sys
This project is a lightweight, small-scale web application designed to help users manage and interact with various aspects of their flea markets. Built using technologies like **SQLite** and **React**, the application provides a simple interface for users to perform essential actions such as adding products, tracking orders, viewing reports, etc.. 
Its primary purpose is to offer an easy-to-use tool that‚Äôs both fast and secure, without the complexity of a full-fledged user authentication system or large database management.

## Instructions

The application is split into two parts: **backEnd** and **frontEnd**.  
Before running the project, make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

### üõ†Ô∏è BackEnd Setup

1. Navigate to the backend project folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Set a `JWT_SECRET` environment variable, then start the server with `npm start`.
4. The API should be running on PORT 3001.

### üíª FrontEnd Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend project folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.
4. The app should be running on PORT 3000.
5. A password is needed to be able to login.

The frontend will connect to the backend automatically if both are running on their default ports.

## Accessibility

- Added `tabIndex` and handled `onKeyDown` to support keyboard navigation. This enables activation via **Enter** or **Space**, and makes the row accessible to screen readers ‚Äî since `<tr>` elements aren‚Äôt focusable or interactive by default.
- Included `<caption>` elements in all tables to clearly describe their contents.  
- Used semantic HTML to improve screen reader compatibility.  
- Applied accessible font styling: increased base size, chose a dyslexia-friendly font family, and focused on readability.  
- Ensured strong contrast between backgrounds and text or interactive elements.

> [!NOTE]
> Lighthouse score is **100** for both **Accessibility** and **SEO**.

## Tracking & Privacy

The project uses **Google Analytics** to collect anonymized usage data, such as page views and user interactions, to better understand how users navigate the application and identify areas for improvement.
Since it's a small project with limited traffic, tracking helps uncover potential performance issues and improve the overall experience.

To protect users‚Äô privacy, **IP anonymization** is enabled and no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected. Additionally, all data is aggregated, not linked to individuals, and the tracking respects browser **‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù** settings where supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Users who wish to opt out of Google Analytics tracking can install the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Threats and Vulnerabilities

- I am using **SQLite** locally on my machine, which means that if something happens to my computer, it could affect the functionality of the project.

- The database structure cannot be changed while in production due to the way it is implemented. If any changes are needed, I would have to delete the entire database and create a new one.

- Initially, the application was available to anyone without authentication. To mitigate this, I implemented a **unique password**, which is stored in the database. Only users with this password can log in.  
  **Bcrypt** is used to hash the password so that only the hash is stored in the database. Additionally, a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is generated upon login for secure sessions.
